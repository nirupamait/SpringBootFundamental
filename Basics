Traditional Spring Disadvantages::

We use xml and annotations for modules like Core, mvc,dao.
All modules should be present in pom.xml and they should be compatible with each other.

SpringBoot Features::

1)Auto Configuration :: eg for mvc, it will automatically configure Dispatcher Servlet.For ORM, Spring Boot will automatically configure datasource and
Transaction manager.

2)SpringBoot Starters:: Spring boot will take away the problem of "Module Availability" and "Version Control." eg spring-boot-starter-parent::It is present
in every spring-boot project .
spring-boot-starter-web:: For web projectt, we need to include it.We dont need to include any other dependency etc.

spring-boot-starter-data-jpa::For jpa

3)Embedded Servlet Container::We dot need to deploy to external containers, it comes with embedded tomcat,jetty

4)spring boot actuators:: Following health checks are present::

a)autoconfig::Will display auto configuration end-points.

b)mappings::  Give all http request mapping for application.

c)info::Will give information about application
